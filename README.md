# AI Forecasting Platform for Tehran Stock Market (Startup Edition)
üßæ **Originally implemented as a startup concept (Summer 2019 ‚Äì Winter 2020) and restructured for commercial deployment with improved modularity, business-driven modeling, and production-ready engineering practices.**

A commercial AI-driven platform for real-time and end-of-day forecasting of all Tehran Stock Exchange symbols in the name of DeepTSE.  
Built in collaboration with industry partners and academic advisors, it integrates automated data-ingestion pipelines, deep-learning LSTM models, smart feature extraction (technical indicators & news sentiment), and rolling 40-minute predictions.

üß† **Pioneering Deep Learning in Iranian Fintech**  
This project represents one of the earliest commercial startup initiatives in Iran to apply deep learning for short-term forecasting in financial markets.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository contains a **small demo subset** of the original DeepTSE platform, intended for public display only.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This end-to-end platform ingests real-time and end-of-day trading data from all Tehran Stock Exchange symbols, performs smart feature extraction (technical indicators & news sentiment), trains deep-learning LSTM models, and delivers rolling forecasts every 40 minutes.  
Developed solo (CTO, researcher & full-stack engineer) over 1.5 years under the supervision of K. N. Toosi University and commercial stakeholders. Cancelled due to a 90 % market downturn, it remains the first Iranian knowledge-based startup to apply deep learning across all TSE symbols.
In early testing, the deep learning model (LSTM-RNN) achieved over 70% prediction accuracy, using a hybrid input of market data and curated news signals.

## üìä System Overview: Forecasting & Portfolio Construction

This repository includes a modular architecture for stock forecasting and portfolio optimization.  
The following subsystems are integrated into the overall design:

### üîÅ Automated Buy/Sell Signal System
- Executes trades based on technical and fundamental signals  
- Uses algorithmic trading strategies  
- Manages risk and capital allocation  
- Logs and tracks executed trades  
- Evaluates trade performance and improves strategies

### üìà Stock Selection System
- Selects stocks using fundamental, technical, and financial criteria  
- Applies decision-making models for optimal selection  
- Compares performance across multiple stocks  
- Prioritizes high-growth, low-risk assets  
- Updates selected stock list based on market changes

### üß† Portfolio Enhancement System
- Analyzes current portfolio performance  
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses  
- Suggests adjustments for better results  
- Implements proposed changes  
- Continuously evaluates and improves portfolio composition

### üìÖ System Scheduling Module
- Defines timeframes for data analysis  
- Schedules trading execution windows  
- Sets evaluation intervals for system performance  
- Updates scheduling based on market dynamics

> üóÇÔ∏è Portfolio updates are performed on a **weekly or monthly** basis.

### üìä Forecasting Logic

Every 40 minutes, the system generates a numeric forecast for each symbol based on:

- Technical indicators (price, volume, volatility)
- News sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Historical impact of similar news events

The model outputs a predicted price and confidence score, which feeds into the recommendation engine.

## üìâ Simulation & Hierarchical Forecasting Samples

The following charts illustrate key components of DeepTSE‚Äôs simulation and forecasting logic.  
All visualizations are generated by the platform‚Äôs internal model and are used for demonstration purposes only.  
¬© All rights reserved by Ehsan Lesani and BesparWeb.

### üéÆ Buy/Sell Simulation ‚Äì Intraday Session

These two charts represent a simulated trading session for a single symbol during one trading day.  
The orange line shows the **actual market price**, while the blue line reflects the **forecast generated by the primary model**.  
Green upward-pointing triangles and red downward-pointing triangles mark the **optimal buy and sell points**, respectively‚Äîselected to maximize profit **without incurring excessive transaction costs**.

This simulation engine enables the model to virtually execute trades and track profit/loss in real time.  
Importantly, a **secondary model** was designed to learn and refine these threshold points for daily trading decisions, based on the forecasted price trajectory.  
Together, the forecasting and threshold models form a feedback loop that helps identify weaknesses, improve strategy, and enhance overall accuracy through iterative simulation.

![Buy/Sell Simulation ‚Äì Sample 1](screenshots/image-1.jpg)  
![Buy/Sell Simulation ‚Äì Sample 2](screenshots/image-2.jpg)

### üîÅ Hierarchical Forecasting ‚Äì Multi-Day Chart

This chart demonstrates DeepTSE‚Äôs **hierarchical forecasting** capability.  
Each trading day includes 4 hours of activity, segmented into 25-minute intervals.  
The model first predicts the immediate next 25-minute window, then recursively forecasts subsequent intervals with reasonable accuracy.

In the final 25-minute segment, the model successfully predicts a **breakout above resistance**, leading to a sharp price increase.  
This type of layered forecasting is essential for short-term strategy planning and dynamic signal generation.

All financial data used in this project was collected from publicly available sources for demonstration and research purposes only.  
No proprietary or commercial redistribution is involved.

During the final stages of development, we planned to acquire commercial-grade APIs from the Tehran Stock Exchange to enable real-time data integration for our forecasting models.  
However, due to the historic market crash and investor withdrawal, the project was halted before reaching full deployment.  
The platform was approximately **80% complete** at the time of cancellation.

This project was originally initiated at the direct request of Dr. Hossein Khasteh, one of the leading professors at K. N. Toosi University of Technology ‚Äî one of Iran‚Äôs top engineering universities ‚Äî based on Ehsan Lesani‚Äôs proven technical capabilities and prior work in AI and financial modeling.  
Dr. Khasteh served as a strategic advisor and facilitator during the early stages, proposing the startup concept and supporting its initial direction.  
While the collaboration included a conditional revenue-sharing agreement, the technical development and final architecture were independently executed by Ehsan Lesani.  
Special thanks to Dr. Hossein Khasteh for his early vision and encouragement.
